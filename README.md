# Rently  
## (Abandoned)  
Educational and demo project inspired by the design of Airbnb.  
The goal of the project was to develop a web application using React (front-end), Spring Boot (back-end) and PostgreSQL (database) technologies. The project was demonstrative and educational in nature, serving to deepen the understanding of modern tools used in full-stack applications.  
  
Because of time constraints resulting from academic obligations, the project was put on hold at the development stage. This decision allowed me to focus on improving my skills in Java and the Spring Boot framework, which I consider more strategic for my further development as a backend developer.
